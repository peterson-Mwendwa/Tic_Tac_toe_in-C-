# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe Game - C++ Edition 🎮

Welcome to the **Tic-Tac-Toe** game, a fun and interactive console game where you can challenge your friends or test your skills against an AI! 🤩  
This project is developed in **C++** and features both **Player vs Player** and **Player vs AI** modes. Whether you're playing with a friend or going solo against a computer, you're in for some exciting gameplay! 🏆

## 🌟 Features 🌟

- **Player vs Player**: Compete with a friend locally! 👯‍♂️
- **Player vs AI**: Challenge an AI with two difficulty levels! 🤖
  - **Easy AI**: The AI makes random moves (Great for beginners!) 😎
  - **Hard AI**: An unbeatable AI using the minimax algorithm (Prepare for a challenge!) 💪
- **Interactive Game Board**: A clear and visually appealing 3x3 grid for players to place their moves! 💥
- **Winning and Tie Detection**: The game will announce when a player wins or if the game ends in a tie! 🎉
- **Cute Emojis**: Cute and interactive emojis to make the game even more fun! 🥳

## 🕹️ How It Works 🕹️

### 1. **Game Setup** 🛠️

- The game initializes a **3x3 grid** where players can place either an "X" or an "O".
- Players can choose between **two modes**:
  - **Player vs Player**: Two players take turns placing their marks on the grid.
  - **Player vs AI**: One player challenges the AI, with two difficulty levels (Easy or Hard).

### 2. **Player vs Player Mode** 👯

- In this mode, two players take turns to place "X" or "O" on the grid.
- The first player to align three of their marks (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game! 🏅
- If no one wins and all spots are filled, the game ends in a tie! 😅

### 3. **Player vs AI Mode** 🤖

- **Easy AI**: The computer makes random moves with no specific strategy. This is perfect for beginners or casual players. 🧸
- **Hard AI**: The AI uses the **minimax algorithm** to evaluate the best possible move, ensuring that it plays optimally and can be very challenging. 🎯

### 4. **Winning and Tying** 🏆

- If a player aligns three of their marks, the game announces the winner and ends.
- If all spots on the grid are filled and no one wins, the game announces a tie. 🥺

## 📸 Screenshots 📸

Here you can add screenshots of different game options, such as the game start, game board in progress, and winning scenarios. 😍

🤖 AI Details 🤖

    Easy AI: The AI makes random moves, so it’s great for players looking for an easy challenge! 🐒
    Hard AI: The AI uses the minimax algorithm, a decision-making algorithm that ensures it plays optimally and makes it difficult for players to win. It’s a challenge even for experienced players! 🎯
